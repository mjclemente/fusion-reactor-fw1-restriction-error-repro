# Testing FusionReactor Alert Restrictions

1. Add a license key to the .env file. (Or you can activate manually when it starts up.)
2. You should be able to get the example up and running with CommandBox: `box server start`
3. Wait half a minute... (The FusionReactor portal has a delayed 30s startup.)
4. Instructions for reproducing the error should show on the index page.
